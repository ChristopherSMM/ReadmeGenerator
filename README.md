# ReadmeGenerator
For this challenge i created a README generator that uses node.js to make a custom  README file for whoever uses it 
i wanted to create this project in order to get more familiar with node.js and with it i learned how to better use it and other elements of different kinds of javascript
for this challenge i had a lot of help especially from other classmates that helped me understand how to properly install the proper NPM for my project and how to make my app functional
